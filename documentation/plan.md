# Plan

## Dashboard

1. Performance Analytics: Best rated beans, worst rated beans, method performance comparison
2. Trends: Rating trends over time, brewing frequency trends, method usage trends
3. Inventory Insights: Top beans by usage, beans that haven't been used recently, low-stock warnings
4. Goals & Progress: Monthly/weekly targets, quality goals
5. Quick Actions: Quick links to add new brew, add new bean, view all logs
6. Time-based Analytics: Best brewing times, weekend vs weekday patterns
7. Financial Tracking: Coffee spending, cost per cup analysis

## Brews

Current Implementation âœ…

- Brew listing: Shows recent brews with key metrics (dose, yield, time, temperature)
- Loading states: Skeleton components for smooth UX
- Empty state: Nice onboarding when no brews exist
- Responsive design: Grid layout that adapts to screen size
- Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Star ratings: Visual rating display
- Method badges: Color-coded brew method indicators

Missing Key Features ðŸš§

1. CRUD Operations

- Create brew form (/brews/new - button links here but doesn't exist)
- Edit brew functionality
- Delete brew capability
- Individual brew detail pages (/brews/[id])

2. Data Management

- Filtering (by method, rating, date range, bean)
- Sorting (by date, rating, method)
- Search functionality (by bean name, notes, etc.)
- Pagination (currently shows all, could be performance issue)

3. Advanced Features

- Photo display (schema has photoUrl field unused - src/lib/db/schema.ts:144)
- Flavor notes (schema has flavorNotes field unused - src/lib/db/schema.ts:143)
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON for brew data)
- Bulk operations (delete multiple, mark favorites)

4. Enhanced UX

- Quick actions menu (edit/delete/duplicate from card)
- Brew comparison tool
- Brewing statistics/analytics page
- Public brew sharing (schema has isPublic field - src/lib/db/schema.ts:146)

The foundation is solid with good patterns established. The main gaps are the missing CRUD operations and enhanced data
management features that would make this a fully functional brew logging system.
